# Why Clean Code Matters

- reading is harder than writing
    * most details fall out of memory after a few weeks
- technical debt is depressing
    * unclean code causes a lag in the process
- you are lazy
    * create something that is easier to work with later, be the right kind of lazy
- sloppy = slow
    * always easy to say you'll clean it up later, rarely happens, be clean first
    * fast and sloppy causes more issue than it saves
    * clean coding practices speed you up in the long term

## Developers Are Authors

- developers are creators of systems or paths
- on average ech line of code will be read 10 times during its lifetime
- reading code aloud exposes problems, like reading a book aloud would
- parts of a book are allegories to file parts
    * well chosen chapter name = namespace
        * help guide developers to place code in the correct bucket
    * A heading of a paragraph = class names
        * A proper name offers clarity
        * clarity is achieved by a class have a single purpose
