## Understanding The C# Building Blocks

### C# Statements

- executed in a defined order, standard is vertically
- always end with a semicolon
- curley braces surround statements
- line breaks and white space are ignored by compiler

### C# Identifiers

- names assigned to lines to be able to find them
- can include letters, numbers or underscores
- the first letter must be a letter or underscore

### C# Comments

- double slash denotes a comment // ....
- multiline comments can be denoted with /* ... */

### C# Keywords

- reserved words that have a special meaning
- cannot be used as identifier
- can comment using ctrl + k + c
- can uncomment using ctrl + k + u

### C# Variables

- variables are storage locations that hold a value
- must be named uniquily for each context it is used
- can be "typed" (int, string, date, ect)
- the type defines what kind of value it can hold
- created in a declaration statement
    - int age = 25;
    - type name = value
- C# is case sensitive, a variable with lower and uppercase names would be treated differently
- variables are named with a lower case
- variables are named in camelCase
