# Adding Decision and Iteration Statements in C\#

- used when parts of code need to be skipped or repeated
- learn about if while and or
- working with boolean values
- making decisions with the if statements
- using the switch statement
- add iterations

## Working with Boolean Values

- they are true or false statements
- bool type
- boolean operators

### Using a Boolean Value

- can use relational opperators in bool statements
    - == (equal)
    - != (not equal)
    - > or < (greater or less than)
    - >= or <= (greater or less or equal)

### Using Boolean Logical Opperators

- && used if you want true to be returned if both statements return true
- || used if you want true to be returned if either return true
