# Getting Started In C Sharp

## Exploring Files

- Project files contain references to all files used and necessary for the application
- Solution file is a grouping of projects, its function is to organize the project files
- the application file is in the bin/debug/.net6.0 folders
  - the app can be run from here or from the command line

## Debugging Our Code

- a large part of development is debugging

### Breakpoints

- breakpoints are place by clicking on the grey bar to the right of line number, indicated by a red dot
- breakpoints are very useful
- allow us to break apart the running of the code
- pauses the execution and displays it step by step
- Shows the information passed by the app in this state

## Building Apps With the CLI

- everything we do in visual studio we can do in the CLI
- allows us to write code across platforms
- to create an app we would use
  - dotnet new "app type" -n "app name"
  - when project is written you run dotnet build then dotnet run in the solution folder

## Docs

- the microsoft docs are the most informative place to look
- .Net API browser is a great place to be familiar with
